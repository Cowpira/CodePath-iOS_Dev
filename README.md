## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- The problem I had building this app was to edit the buttons properties, for some reason the xCode version 14 that I have is not accepting that I change the properties into code.
- I tried to round the button in the controller but did not accept the changes, so I did manually in the properties window.


## Features added
- change labels color
- rounded button
- labels bounce animattion on the click event
